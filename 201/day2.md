# Day 2

- ".eslintrc.json" file and ". gitignore" file
    - ".eslintrc.json" file is a very helpful tool to make sure your code has the correct style. You can get this done inside of VS code and it need to be under the project root path. 
    - ". gitignore" file is used to tell git do not track some kind of files.

- "put "use strict" on top of every JS file"
    - "use strict"; Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode". With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.
    - Watch Out! The "use strict" directive is only recognized at the beginning of a script or a function.
